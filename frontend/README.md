# frontend

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production. All the files are located in /target/dist so backend will take files only from there.
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
